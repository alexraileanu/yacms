## yacms

YaCMS (yet another content management system) is a small CMS I'm writing python using flask (and many other packages. 
refer to the requirements.txt for the full list). I'm writing it for fun and to learn some more python. Code is far, 
far from perfect (especially the frontend shenanigans) so pls bear with me.

No demo available quite yet.

I chose to have the extension for the templates as .j2 because if I had .html, PyCharm wouldn't be able to distinguish
(as far as I can tell) between an actual html file and a template file (so no syntax highlight or completions). 

The admin layout was borrowed from [here](https://github.com/ConsoleTVs/UIAdmin) go check it out.
