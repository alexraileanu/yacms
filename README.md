## yacms

YaCMS (yet another content management system) is a small CMS I'm writing python using flask (and many other packages. 
refer to the requirements.txt for the full list). I'm writing it for fun and to learn some more python. Code is far, 
far from perfect (especially the frontend shenanigans) so pls bear with me.

No demo available quite yet.

The admin layout was borrowed from [here](https://github.com/ConsoleTVs/UIAdmin) go check it out.
